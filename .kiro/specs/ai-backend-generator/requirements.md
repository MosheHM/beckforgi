# Requirements Document

## Introduction

BackendForge is an AI-powered web application designed to automate the creation of backend systems for software developers and teams. The system addresses the common pain points of setting up boilerplate code, databases, services, and user management from scratch by allowing users to describe their desired backend in natural language. The AI then analyzes, plans, and generates a fully functional, TDD-compliant backend with comprehensive documentation, real-time monitoring, and version control integration. Additionally, BackendForge supports designing deployment orchestration strategies and service management configurations, enabling users to define infrastructure-as-code, container orchestration, scaling policies, and monitoring solutions alongside their backend implementation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to describe my backend needs in natural language so that I can quickly generate a complete backend system without manual setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user inputs a natural language description THEN the system SHALL parse and analyze the requirements
2. WHEN the analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL recommend an optimal tech stack including language, framework, and database options
3. WHEN ambiguous requirements are detected THEN the system SHALL ask clarifying questions through the chat interface
4. WHEN the user confirms the plan THEN the system SHALL proceed to code generation

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the generated backend to follow TDD practices so that I have robust, testable, and maintainable code from the start.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code generation begins THEN the system SHALL write tests first before implementation
2. WHEN tests are written THEN the system SHALL implement minimal code to pass the tests
3. WHEN implementation is complete THEN the system SHALL include comprehensive typing and logging
4. WHEN the backend is generated THEN it SHALL include mock data for database testing
5. WHEN code is generated THEN it SHALL be fully documented with API specifications

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a real-time monitoring interface so that I can inspect, test, and iterate on the generated backend interactively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the interface loads THEN the system SHALL display a split-screen layout with chat on the left and workspace tabs on the right
2. WHEN workspace tabs are accessed THEN the system SHALL show System Diagram, Tests, DB Data, Services Diagram, and Endpoints views
3. WHEN tests are run THEN the system SHALL provide input forms and display results with logs in real-time
4. WHEN issues are detected THEN the system SHALL provide "Solve by AI" buttons for automated fixes
5. WHEN changes are made THEN the system SHALL update documentation and commit to version control automatically

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive documentation that stays current so that I can easily understand, audit, and extend the generated backend.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is generated THEN the system SHALL create documentation with types, schemas, and test examples
2. WHEN modifications are made THEN the system SHALL automatically update the documentation
3. WHEN changes occur THEN the system SHALL maintain a history of modifications with timestamps and reasons
4. WHEN documentation is accessed THEN it SHALL be searchable and collapsible for usability
5. WHEN version control integration is enabled THEN the system SHALL automatically commit changes with appropriate messages

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to export configurations and integrate with other tools so that I can use the generated backend in my full-stack workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN export is requested THEN the system SHALL generate API specifications in standard formats like OpenAPI JSON
2. WHEN SSE mocks are needed THEN the system SHALL create server-sent event mock implementations
3. WHEN integration with frontend tools is required THEN the system SHALL provide compatible configuration exports
4. WHEN live testing is needed THEN the system SHALL deploy the backend to orchestrated containers for real-time previews
5. WHEN analytics are enabled THEN the system SHALL collect anonymized usage data for AI improvement

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want secure and scalable backend generation so that the produced code meets enterprise standards and can handle production workloads.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is generated THEN the system SHALL enforce OWASP security compliance
2. WHEN user authentication is included THEN the system SHALL implement secure JWT-based authentication
3. WHEN database operations are created THEN the system SHALL include proper input validation and sanitization
4. WHEN APIs are generated THEN the system SHALL include rate limiting and proper error handling
5. WHEN multi-tenant features are needed THEN the system SHALL support workspace isolation and user management

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want support for multiple technology stacks so that I can generate backends in my preferred languages and frameworks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN stack selection is available THEN the system SHALL support all major programming languages including but not limited to Node.js, Python, Rust, Java, C++, Go, Ruby, PHP, C#, and TypeScript
2. WHEN database selection is needed THEN the system SHALL offer all major database options including SQL databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, MSSQL, SQLite), NoSQL databases (MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis, DynamoDB), vector databases, and edge function capabilities within databases
3. WHEN framework selection occurs THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate framework recommendations per language, including lightweight and serverless options
4. WHEN templates are used THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent patterns across different technology stacks while optimizing for edge computing when requested
5. WHEN custom preferences are set THEN the system SHALL remember and suggest user's preferred technology choices and architecture patterns including edge function deployments

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a new user, I want guided onboarding and examples so that I can quickly understand how to use the system effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new user logs in THEN the system SHALL display example templates and use cases
2. WHEN onboarding begins THEN the system SHALL provide interactive tutorials through the chat interface
3. WHEN examples are shown THEN they SHALL cover common backend patterns like e-commerce, social media, and APIs
4. WHEN help is needed THEN the system SHALL provide contextual assistance and troubleshooting guidance
5. WHEN learning resources are accessed THEN the system SHALL offer best practices and pattern explanations
